# Maverick Maven
Adding Map Functionality as described on the Shared Google Document.

## Project Proposal
Howdy Igor! this is an outline of how I want to achieve tasks under a time frame.

### Outline

| Task                |  Time Frame         |Specifics |
| -------------       |  -------------      |------    |
| UI Updates          | Tuesday 12 Jul 22   | Create a sidebar to Your job is to incorporate the JSON2 file data into the display (like in the mockup)|
| Enable JSON2 edits  | Monday 18 Jul 22       | The ability to edit JSON2  data will require server-side scripting, my preferred language is PHP|
| Transcription using Scription  | Wed 21 Jul 22       |  Add the ability to edit transcribed data via an editor displayed in a pop-up modal |
| Clipping of Mp3 files  | Undecided      |  This will require brainstorming, I have not worked on something similar before. |

#### My timing.
I genuinely seek to work on this project, I also welcome kind and patient clients.
With my brief experience, I seek to learn and share my finding in my daily job submissions and interactions.
I acknowledge my work and all consequences affiliated to it.
